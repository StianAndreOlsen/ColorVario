This button is made (using GIMP) from Quit.png:
1. Change the white to transparency (Colors | Color to Alpha)
2. Change the red to a darker red (800000) (Colors | Map | Color Exchange)
3. Make an elliptic selection that covers internals that are supposed to be white and create a layer from the selection (Layer | New from Visible)
4. Fill the layer with white and push it to the back (Layer | Stack | Lower Layer)
