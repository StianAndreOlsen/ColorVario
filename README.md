## History

The initial repository was a [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) repository stored at [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
In 2020 this repository was imported to GitHub and thus converted to a Git repository.
All commits prior to 2020 are originally committed to the Mercurial/Bitbucket repository.
However, GitHub's import tool seems to have done a very good job! :-)
